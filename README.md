Kowloon Walled City is a simulation game written in plain old vanilla JavaSript, HTML, and CSS. 

The game, as the name suggests, is loosely based off a tower block in Hong Kong that was demolished.
For this who don't know, the land the tower block was built on belonged to no government, but because of migrant workers, 
refugees, and the like there was demand for cheap, low cost living. So without a government to stop them, developers built 
building on top of building to fullfill the demand. There was no running power, sewage, water, or waste pick up.
